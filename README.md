- **SEC_003**: Junction X (0.2km, 1 capacity)
- **SEC_004**: Main Line South (8km, 1 capacity)
- **SEC_005**: Platform B (0.5km, 2 capacity)

### Sample Trains
- **12345**: Express train (High priority)
- **56789**: Local train (Medium priority)  
- **FR001**: Freight train (Low priority)

## System Capabilities

### Optimization Features
- **Priority-based scheduling**: Higher priority trains get precedence
- **Conflict minimization**: Reduces overlapping schedules
- **Delay optimization**: Balances delays across the network
